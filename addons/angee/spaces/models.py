"""Shared groups, their canonical role-bearing roster, and group-thread binding.

``Group`` is a shared tree rather than a user-scoped organising list. Its
``visibility`` is a persisted fact whose owner maintains the public
``reader@auth/user:*`` tuple. ``Membership`` is the one canonical roster edge;
confirmed rows whose party resolves to a platform ``Person.user`` maintain one
direct group-role tuple. The granted platform user is persisted on the membership
so later revocation uses the identity that actually received the grant, never a
fresh interpretation of a changed Party. A party without a platform user remains
a valid roster row and deliberately grants nothing.

``ThreadSpace`` contributes the nullable group pointer onto the existing
``messaging.Thread`` row. It is an abstract same-row extension, never another
runtime model or table.

**Pitfalls.** Group visibility and membership grants are reconciled by instance
``save()``; bulk APIs that bypass it (``bulk_create`` and ``QuerySet.update``)
also bypass tuple upkeep. The spaces-owned Person receiver covers ordinary
``Person.save()`` changes to ``user_id``, but a queryset update or a database
``SET_NULL`` cascade does not emit that signal; those paths can leave a stale
tuple and require an explicit repair pass. Reconciliation is idempotent and runs
inside the row transaction, but it does not lock a membership loaded earlier;
concurrent saves can interleave and the last committed writer's state wins.
