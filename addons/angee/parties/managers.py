"""Managers that own the directory-sync write path for parties.

A directory backend parses a source into neutral ``ParsedContact`` rows; these
managers turn one into a ``Party`` (a ``Person``) and its ``Handle`` /
``PartyHandle`` / ``Address`` rows. A contact is keyed by its source UID within
its folder (the idempotent ``(folder, source_uid)`` upsert), handles dedupe on
``(platform, value)``, and ``handle_count`` plus the resolved ``Handle.party`` are
maintained here in the same transaction — so every directory source shares one
write path (the map lives on the models, not in each backend) and a re-sync
converges instead of duplicating. The sync runs under ``system_context``, so
``created_by`` is set explicitly to the directory owner.
