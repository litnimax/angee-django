"""Tags: a polymorphic shared labelling vocabulary.

A :class:`Tag` is one label in a vocabulary; a :class:`TagAssignment` is the
polymorphic edge attaching a tag to **any** row. The edge follows the
``storage.FileAttachment`` canon exactly — a ``content_type``/``object_id`` pair
with a :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey` ``target`` —
so tags depend on nothing but ``angee.iam`` and reach every model without a FK
back to it. Consumers attach explicitly through
:meth:`TagAssignmentManager.attach` (create the edge against the concrete target)
exactly as storage consumers attach a file.

**Scope.** Base tags are shared vocabulary, readable by every authenticated actor
through a wildcard ``shared@auth/user:*`` reader tuple maintained by
:meth:`Tag.save`. Downstream addons may extend the row with their own scope field
and override :attr:`is_shared_scope`; the base model declares which stored fields
back that fact through :attr:`shared_scope_source_fields` so deferred loads do not
snapshot an unloaded value.

**Pitfalls.** Shared-tag visibility rides :meth:`Tag.save`: any write path that
skips ``save()`` — ``bulk_create``, ``queryset.update(...)``, raw
``loaddata`` — leaves the wildcard reader stale (an invisible shared tag or a
lingering everyone-grant); route scope changes through instance saves. And the
tuple write validates against the *loaded* REBAC schema, so creating a tag
requires ``rebac sync`` to have run first — the standard loop order
(``migrate`` → ``rebac sync`` → ``resources load``) already guarantees it.

**Party tags** compose this addon without any ``parties`` change: a party is
tagged by attaching to its ``Party`` row (the canon's explicit-attach path). The
ergonomic reverse accessor (``GenericRelation("tags.TagAssignment")`` on
``Party``) is a ``parties``-owned decision — adding it makes ``parties`` depend
on ``tags`` for every composing project, so it lands in ``parties`` (model +
``addon.toml`` dependency together) only when that dependency is wanted. Declare
that reverse relation on ``Party`` itself — the topmost REBAC-typed MTI ancestor
the canonical edge keys on (:func:`angee.base.refs.canonical_record_target`), never
on a ``Person``/``Organization`` child — so the delete collector filters at the same
content type the write used (the placement invariant in :mod:`angee.base.refs`).
