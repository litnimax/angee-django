"""The auto-CRUD create gate honors model-owned input defaults.

``tests.scopedemo.ScopeScopedMixin.scope`` is blank-on-input and defaulted from
the acting user's sole membership on ``save()``. The Hasura write backend's
create preflight evaluates the REBAC ``create`` permission against the *unsaved*
row before ``save()`` runs, so a relation-arm-gated model (``create =
scope->member``) would fail-close unless the gate sees the scope the row will
persist with. These drive the real gate over a built schema:

1. single-membership actor, no scope input -> gate passes, row persists with the
   defaulted scope;
2. multi-membership actor, no scope -> field-named ``ValidationError``;
3. caller-supplied scope the actor is not a member of -> denied by the gate;
4. caller-supplied scope the actor is a member of -> allowed.

The form-facing ``get_create_defaults`` shares the same membership rule and is
pinned here too: a sole membership is offered, an unresolvable default is
omitted (never raised), and a caller seed wins over the derived value.
